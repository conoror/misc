# imginf

This dumps out jpeg and png image information in either a summary
basis or a detailed basis.

pnginf is pretty brief but jpginf dumps out lots of exif and gps information
if it's there.

On either Windows or Unix type make to compile. The windows version does
assume the use of mingw and that gcc is in your path already.
